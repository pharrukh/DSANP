# Problem 6
## Max and Min in a Unsorted Array

### Efficiency

- space   O(n)
- time    O(n)

Space complexity is O(n) for collection size.
Time complexity is O(n) as there is a single traversal.

### Code Design

I would assume that this problem ended up to balance the difficulty of their problems; that is pretty straightforward.
