# Problem 1
## Finding the Square Root of an Integer

### Efficiency

- space   O(log(n))
- time    O(nlog(n))

Space complexity is O(log(n)) because of the call stack in the quicksort.
Time complexity is of quicksort is O(nlog(n)) + O(n) for single traversal of the sorted collection that boils down to O(nlog(n)).

### Code Design

Best sort by time complexity was chosen.
