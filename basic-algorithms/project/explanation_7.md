# Problem 7
## HTTPRouter using a Trie

### Efficiency

- add handler
    - time complexity O(n) where n is the length of a world
    - space complexity - not applicable as it uses the class to store values

- lookup
    - time complexity O(n) where n is the length of a world
    - space complexity - not applicable as it uses the class to store values

- overall
    - space complexity depends on how nested are the routes

### Code Design

I tried to reuse most of the code from "Autocomplete with Tries" problems.
