# Problem 4
## Dutch National Flag Problem

### Efficiency

- space   O(n)
- time    O(n)

Space complexity is O(n) for collection size.
Time complexity is O(n) as there is single traversal.

### Code Design

Three pointers in the array is the key to problem sovling along with caring only about moving zeros to the left and twos to the right. Ones are sorted automatically.
